This is a fork off of the original 1.0 release version of the OSE system for Foundry VTT by U~Man.
I have kept it in sync with his newer changes through 1.0.8, incorporated several bugfixes, and instituted system changes which I will list here.

v0.5.0 Initial Release
MAJOR FEATURES:
Defaulted to exploding 20s in combat from HFH optional rules
Added BHR to the character sheet from HFH optional rules
Changed Ascending Armor Class to ACKS AC
Uncapped the dexterity and charisma bonuses
Implemented ACKS encumbrance rules (uses coin weight instead of stone - 1000 coins to a stone)
Changed default exploration checks (hear noise, open door, etc) to ACKS style rolls instead of 1d6 checks
Added more tweaks to the tweak section, to allow for ACKS proficiencies modifying throws, AC, and more.
Changed "Slow weapon" to subtract 1 from initiative instead of making the character last in the order.
Added a HOLD TURN icon to the Combat Tracker to remind the judge that a player has held their action.
Modified the encumbrance bar to reflect ACKS standard movement penalties while encumbered, and to show that on the bar.

MINOR CHANGES:
Renamed saving throws to be in-line with ACKS standards and order
Changed literacy to match ACKS standards
Added Auran languages and removed alignment tongues
Changed LR to Morale for Henchmen (To-do: Add roll table for Morale Checks instead of OSE roll-under)
Changed monster reaction rolls to match ACKS language
Changed default monster saves to match ACKS numbers (actually makes monsters a bit less resistant overall)
Removed DAC field from armor items

BUG FIXES:
Fixed a rounding error present in the OSE code
Fixed some areas where AC was not shown correctly in OSE code

v0.5.1 HFH Options / Core Toggle
MINOR CHANGES:
Added toggle for Exploding 20s and BHR
Implemented auto-miss on 1 and auto-hit on 20 for Core Rules (non-HFH)

BUG FIXES:
Monster Saves pre-fill not present when monster is new
Negative Con mod could make HD roll negative (now floored at 1)
Negative Str mod could make damage negative (now minimum 1)

v0.5.2 Houserule: Wisdom bonus to all saves
MINOR CHANGES:
Added the popular wisdom bonus houserule to settings menu. Selecting it removes the prompt during rolling a save and declutters the Save vs Magic field from the sheet.

v0.5.3 Morale and Loyalty systems
MINOR CHANGES:
On retainer sheets, Morale and Loyalty can now be rolled by clicking on their fields.
Morale should be a number (typically between -6 and +4) and Loyalty is a text field, in which the Judge can write things to remind him of any bonuses or penalties that need to be applied to the Morale or Loyalty check.
Morale rolls are made each time the henchman suffers a calamity. A calamity includes suffering an energy drain, a curse, a magical disease, or being nearly killed (Judge’s discretion).
Loyalty rolls should make a morale roll for each henchman at the end of each adventure whenever the henchman has leveled up, to determine if the henchman strikes off on his own or remains with the adventurer.
