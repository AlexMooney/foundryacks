This is a fork off of the original 1.0 release version of the OSE system for Foundry VTT by U~Man.
I have kept it in sync with his newer changes through 1.0.8, incorporated several bugfixes, and instituted system changes which I will list here.

v0.5.0 Initial Release
MAJOR FEATURES:
Defaulted to exploding 20s in combat from HFH optional rules
Added BHR to the character sheet from HFH optional rules
Changed Ascending Armor Class to ACKS AC
Uncapped the dexterity and charisma bonuses
Implemented ACKS encumbrance rules (uses coin weight instead of stone - 1000 coins to a stone)
Changed default exploration checks (hear noise, open door, etc) to ACKS style rolls instead of 1d6 checks
Added more tweaks to the tweak section, to allow for ACKS proficiencies modifying throws, AC, and more.
Changed "Slow weapon" to subtract 1 from initiative instead of making the character last in the order.
Added a HOLD TURN icon to the Combat Tracker to remind the judge that a player has held their action.
Modified the encumbrance bar to reflect ACKS standard movement penalties while encumbered, and to show that on the bar.

MINOR CHANGES:
Renamed saving throws to be in-line with ACKS standards and order
Changed literacy to match ACKS standards
Added Auran languages and removed alignment tongues
Changed LR to Morale for Henchmen (To-do: Add roll table for Morale Checks instead of OSE roll-under)
Changed monster reaction rolls to match ACKS language
Changed default monster saves to match ACKS numbers (actually makes monsters a bit less resistant overall)
Removed DAC field from armor items

BUG FIXES:
Fixed a rounding error present in the OSE code
Fixed some areas where AC was not shown correctly in OSE code
