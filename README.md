# ACKS System for Foundry VTT (Unofficial)
All the features you need to play ACKS in Foundry VTT. Forked off of Old School Essentials by U~Man and heavily modified.

## License
This Foundry VTT system requires ACKS Core Rules that you can find at http://autarch.co/buy-now.
This third party product is not affiliated with or approved by Autarch.

## Artwork
Weapon quality icons, and the Treasure chest are from Rexxard. Other graphics are from the Old School Essentials System for Foundry VTT (Unofficial) by U~man which can be found at https://gitlab.com/mesfoliesludiques/foundryvtt-ose

## Manual Installation
I plan on eventually publishing the system to the Foundry repository, but until then, just download and unzip the latest deployment package into the SYSTEMS subfolder in your FoundryVTT Data folder. (Ex: "*FoundryVTT Folder*\Data\Systems\acks")
