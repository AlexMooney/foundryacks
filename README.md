# **Adventurer Conqueror King System** for Foundry VTT

---
This game system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop provides character sheet and game system support for the Adventurer Conqueror King System (ACKS).

This system provides mechanics and character sheet support, and features a compendium for Monsters, Items, Spells, Abilities, and more, all to make the judge's job easier for running ACKS games on the Foundry VTT. ACKS, like most B/X clones, is also broadly compatible with thousands of modules and other OSR content and rulesets with a minimum of conversion necessary.
