# ACKS System for Foundry VTT (Unofficial)
All the features you need to play ACKS in Foundry VTT. Forked off of Old School Essentials by U~Man and heavily modified.

## Features
Defaulted to exploding 20s in combat from HFH optional rules\
Added BHR to the character sheet from HFH optional rules\
Changed Ascending Armor Class to ACKS AC\
Uncapped the dexterity and charisma bonuses\
Implemented ACKS encumbrance rules (uses coin weight instead of stone - 1000 coins to a stone)\
Changed default exploration checks (hear noise, open door, etc) to ACKS style rolls instead of 1d6 checks\
Added more tweaks to the tweak section, to allow for ACKS proficiencies modifying throws, AC, and more.\
Changed "Slow weapon" to subtract 1 from initiative instead of making the character last in the order.\
Added a HOLD TURN icon to the Combat Tracker to remind the judge that a player has held their action.\
Modified the encumbrance bar to reflect ACKS standard movement penalties while encumbered, and to show that on the bar\
Changed default monster saves to match ACKS numbers (actually makes monsters a bit less resistant overall)\
Added Auran languages and removed alignment tongues
